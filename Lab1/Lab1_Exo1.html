    <h2 id="point1">Brief History </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Palestine</strong> was among former Ottoman territories placed under UK administration by the League of Nations in 1922. 
        All of these territories eventually became fully independent States, except <strong>Palestine</strong>, where in addition to “the
         rendering of administrative assistance and advice” the British Mandate incorporated the “Balfour Declaration” of 1917, expressing
          support for “the establishment in <strong>Palestine</strong> of a national home for the Jewish people”. During the Mandate, from
           1922 to 1947, large-scale Jewish immigration, mainly from Eastern Europe took place, the numbers swelling in the 1930s with the
            Nazi persecution. Arab demands for independence and resistance to immigration led to a rebellion in 1937, followed by continuing
             terrorism and violence from both sides. UK considered various formulas to bring independence to a land ravaged by violence. In 
             1947, the UK turned the <strong>Palestine</strong> problem over to the UN
    After looking at alternatives, the UN proposed terminating the Mandate and partitioning <strong>Palestine</strong> into two independent
     States, 
    one Palestinian Arab and the other Jewish, with Jerusalem internationalized (Resolution 181 (II) of 1947). One of the two envisaged
     States proclaimed its independence as <b>Israel</b> and in the 1948 war involving neighbouring Arab States expanded to 77 percent 
     of the territory of mandate <strong>Palestine</strong>, including the larger part of Jerusalem. Over half of the Palestinian Arab
      population fled or were expelled. Jordan and Egypt controlled the rest of the territory assigned by resolution 181 to the Arab State.
       In the 1967 war, <b>Israel</b> occupied these territories (Gaza Strip and the West Bank) including East Jerusalem, 
       which was subsequently annexed by <b>Israel</b>. The war brought about a second exodus of Palestinians, estimated at half a 
       million. Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) formulated the principles of a just and lasting peace, including an Israeli 
       withdrawal from territories occupied in the conflict, a just settlement of the refugee problem, and the termination of all 
       claims or states of belligerency. The 1973 hostilities were followed by Security Council Resolution 338, which inter alia called
        for peace negotiations between the parties concerned. In 1974 the General Assembly reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the 
        Palestinian people to self-determination, national independence, sovereignty, and to return. The following year, the General 
        Assembly established the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and conferred on the PLO
         the status of observer in the Assembly and in UN conferences. </p>
In June 1982, <b>Israel</b> invaded Lebanon with the declared intention to eliminate the PLO. A cease-fire was arranged. PLO troops
     withdrew from Beirut and were transferred to neighboring countries. Despite the guarantees of safety for <strong>Palestine</strong>
      refugees left behind, a large-scale massacre took place in the Sabra and Shatila camps. In September 1983, the International 
      Conference on the Question of <strong>Palestine</strong> (ICQP) adopted the following principles: the need to oppose Israeli
       settlements and Israeli actions to change the status of Jerusalem, the right of all States in the region to existence within 
       secure and internationally recognized boundaries, and the attainment of the legitimate, inalienable rights of the Palestinian 
       people. In 1987, a mass uprising against the Israeli occupation began in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (the intifada).
        Methods used by the Israeli forces resulted in mass injuries and heavy loss of life among the civilian Palestinian population. 
        In 1988 the <strong>Palestine</strong> National Council meeting in Algiers proclaimed the establishment of the  State of 
        
        <strong>Palestine</strong>
    ,A Peace Conference was convened in Madrid in 1991, with the aim of achieving a peaceful settlement through direct negotiations
         along 2 tracks: between <b>Israel</b> and the Arab States, and between <b>Israel</b> and the Palestinians, based on Security 
         Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The multilateral track negotiations were to focus on region-wide issues such as
          the environment, arms control, refugees, water, and the economy. A series of subsequent negotiations culminated in the mutual 
          recognition between the Government of <b>Israel</b> and the PLO, the representative of the Palestinian people, and the signing
           in 1993 of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (DOP or “Oslo Accord”), as well as the
            subsequent implementation agreements, which led to the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, the elections to the Palestinian 
            Council and the Presidency of the Palestinian Authority, the partial release of prisoners and the establishment of a
            functioning administration in the areas under Palestinian self-rule. The involvement of the UN has been essential both
             as the guardian of international legitimacy and in the mobilization and provision of international assistance. The 1993
              DOP deferred certain issues to subsequent permanent status negotiations, which were held in 2000 at Camp David and in 
              2001 in Taba, but proved inconclusive.

<p>The visit by Ariel Sharon of the Likud to Al-Haram Al-Sharif (Temple Mount) in Jerusalem in 2000 was followed by the second 
    intifada. <b>Israel</b> began the construction of a West Bank separation wall, located mostly within the Occupied Palestinian 
    Territory, ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice. In 2002, the Security Council affirmed a vision of two States,
    <b>Israel</b> and <strong>Palestine</strong>. In 2002 the Arab League adopted the Arab Peace Initiative. In 2003, the 
    Quartet (US, EU, Russia, and the UN) released a Road Map to a two-State solution. An unofficial Geneva peace accord was
     promulgated by prominent Israelis and Palestinians in 2003. In 2005, <b>Israel</b> withdrew its settlers and troops from Gaza 
     while retaining control over its borders, seashore and airspace. Following Palestinian legislative elections of 2006, the Quartet 
     conditioned assistance to the PA on its commitment to nonviolence, recognition of <b>Israel</b>, and acceptance of previous 
     agreements. After an armed takeover of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, <b>Israel</b> imposed a blockade. The Annapolis process of 2007-2008 
     failed to yield a permanent status agreement. Escalating rocket fire and air strikes in late 2008 culminated in Israeli ground 
     operation “Cast Lead” in Gaza. The UN Security Council adopted resolution 1860. Violations of international law during the Gaza
      conflict were investigated by the UN (“Goldstone report“).
    The 2009 PA programme to build State institutions received wide international support. A new round of negotiations in 2010 broke 
    down following the expiration of the Israeli settlement moratorium. In 2011 President Mahmoud Abbas submitted the application of 
    <strong>Palestine</strong> for membership in the UN. UNESCO admitted <strong>Palestine</strong> as a Member. Exploratory 
    Israeli-Palestinian talks were held in early 2012 in Amman. In November another cycle of violence between <b>Israel</b> and 
    Gaza concluded with an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire. On 29 November 2012 <strong>Palestine</strong> was granted non-member 
    observer State status in the UN. The General Assembly proclaimed 2014 an International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian 
    People. A new round of negotiations begun in 2013 was suspended by <b>Israel</b> in April 2014 following the announcement of a 
    Palestinian national consensus Government. Another round of fighting between <b>Israel</b> and Gaza took place in July-August 2014.
     In 2016 the Security Council adopted resolution 2334 on settlements. In 2017, the US Administration announced recognition of 
     Jerusalem as the capital of <b>Israel</b>, and subsequently, the US and certain other embassies were moved to Jerusalem. 
     In 2020, the US mediated agreements to normalize relations between <b>Israel</b> and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco 
     (“Abraham Accords”).
    In May 2023 the UN commemorated the Nakba anniversary. In October, a major escalation between Gaza and <b>Israel</b> began. 
    South Africa filed an ICJ case against <b>Israel</b> alleging <b>genocide</b>. While the case progressed, 
    the Court ordered <b>Israel</b> to prevent <b>genocide</b>, enable provision of basic services and aid in Gaza,
     and curb incitement to <b>genocide</b>. In May 2024 State of <strong>Palestine</strong> was granted additional
     rights and privileges at the UN. In July the International Court of Justice found Israel’s presence in the OPT unlawful:
      <strong><em><b>Israel</b> should bring it to an end as rapidly as possible</em></strong>, cease settlement activities, 
      evacuate settlers, and make reparations. In September the General Assembly demanded that <b>Israel</b> end its occupation 
      in 12 months. In January 2025 a Gaza ceasefire came into effect.</p>
